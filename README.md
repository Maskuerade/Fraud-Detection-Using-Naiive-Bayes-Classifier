# Fraud Detection Using Naive Bayes Classifier

## ${\color{salmon} {Problem\: Definition}}$
In today's rapidly advancing world, financial institutions and businesses face increasing risks of fraud, necessitating robust tools for risk management and fraud prevention. Accurately predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent is crucial for mitigating financial losses and ensuring trust in financial systems.

Our project focuses on building a **Fraud Transaction Classifier** using the Naive Bayes algorithm. By analyzing various transaction features, the model will predict whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or legitimate, thus helping organizations take proactive measures.

### Key Highlights:
- 30 features from transaction data are used to classify transactions.
- The model is built on the probabilistic **Naive Bayes** algorithm, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.

### Bayes' Theorem Derivation
The Naive Bayes classifier is based on the Bayes' theorem, which allows us to compute the probability of a transaction being fraudulent given its features. The classifier assumes independence among features, and the probability is calculated as follows:

$$
P(X=x1|Y=y) \times P(X=x2|Y=y) \times ... \times P(X=xn|Y=y) \times P(Y=y)
$$

Where:
- \( P(X=x1|Y=y) \) represents the probability of feature \( x1 \) given the class \( Y=y \) (fraud or genuine).
- \( P(Y=y) \) is the prior probability of the transaction being fraud or genuine.
- \( n \) is the total number of features.

## ${\color{salmon} {Project\: Workflow}}$

### $\color{skyblue}{1.\ Data\: Preparation}$
- **Dataset**: Collect historical transaction data containing both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
- **Features**: The dataset should include independent variables (features) such as transaction amount, time, merchant details, etc., and the dependent variable (fraudulent or not).

### $\color{skyblue}{2.\ Data\: Preprocessing}$
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Normalization**: Normalize feature values for consistent scaling.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into a **training set** and **testing set**.

### $\color{skyblue}{3.\ Training}$
- **Model Training**: Using the training set, calculate the likelihood of each feature given the transaction class (fraud or genuine).
- **Prior Probabilities**: Calculate prior probabilities for both fraud and genuine classes.

### $\color{skyblue}{4.\ Naive\: Bayes\: Classifier}$
- **Prediction**: For a new transaction, compute the posterior probabilities for both fraud and genuine classes using the Bayes' rule.
- **Classification**: Assign the class with the highest posterior probability as the predicted class.

### $\color{skyblue}{5.\ Evaluation}$
- **Model Evaluation**: Use the testing set to assess the model's performance in terms of **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **Adjustments**: Based on the evaluation, fine-tune the model and optimize feature selection.

### $\color{skyblue}{6.\ Prediction}$
- **Deployment**: Apply the trained Naive Bayes classifier to unseen transaction data to predict their likelihood of fraud.

## ${\color{salmon} {Conclusion}}$
The Naive Bayes classifier is a powerful tool for fraud detection due to its simplicity and efficiency in handling classification problems, especially when features are independent. By implementing this model, financial institutions can better manage risk and mitigate losses from fraudulent activities.
