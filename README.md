To create a GitHub repository for your fraud detection project using the Naive Bayes classifier, you can follow the structure below:

### Repository Structure:

```

│   └── transactions.csv         # Dataset containing transaction data with labels (fraudulent/genuine)
│
├── src/
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py    # Script for cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting the dataset
│   ├── training.py              # Script for training the Naive Bayes classifier

│   └── prediction.py            # Script for predicting fraud in new transactions
│
├── notebooks/

│   └── model_training.ipynb               # Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation
│
├── README.md                  # Detailed explanation of the project
├── requirements.txt           # List of dependencies
└── LICENSE                    # License for the project
```

### Steps to Follow:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Create a folder called `data/` and place your dataset (`transactions.csv`) in it.
   - In the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb` file, perform data exploration (visualizations, basic statistics).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Create a `src/data_preprocessing.py` script that loads the dataset, handles missing values, outliers, and normalizes the features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Training**:
   - In `src/training.py`, implement the Naive Bayes classifier using `sklearn`.
   - Train the model using the training set and save the trained model.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - In `src/evaluation.py`, evaluate the model using the test set.
   - Compute metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction**:
   - In `src/prediction.py`, load the trained model and use it to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or not.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update the `README.md` with the problem definition, dataset description, steps, and model usage.

### Sample `README.md`:

# Fraud Detection Using Naive Bayes Classifier

## Problem Definition

In this project, we aim to detect fraudulent transactions using a Naive Bayes classifier. The goal is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on historical data and multiple features.

## Application of Naive Bayes

We utilize the Bayes' rule to compute the posterior probability of each transaction being fraudulent or genuine based on the given features.

### Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(X=x1|Y=y) \times P(X=x2|Y=y) \times ... \times P(X=xn|Y=y) \times P(Y=y) \]

### Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Collect historical transaction data containing genuine and fraudulent transactions.
   - The dataset includes 30 features and a label indicating the transaction's status.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the features.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the training set.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the status of new transactions.
